# Markdown Style Guide

> Last update: May 21st, 2024

## Tabs and spacing

The use of the normal tab (*also known as a hard tab*) character (`\t`) is not allowed! You may use **two** whitespace characters instead of tabs to space code!


```md
- **What spacing is allowed?**
	- This is not allowed! (used \t)
    - This is not allowed!
  - This is correct! (used 2 whitespace characters)
```

## File start

All markdown files should start with a main headline, followed by a note that specifies the last update date!

```md
# File Headline

> Last update: <Month> <Day>, <Year>

<!--
  Date example: May 21st, 2024
-->
```

## Capitalisation

All headlines should be capitalised. And the contents of the markdown file should be capitalised according to normal capitalisation rules in English.
