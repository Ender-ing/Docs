## Tabs and spacing

The use of the normal tab (*also known as a hard tab*) character (`\t`) is not allowed! You may use **four** whitespace characters instead of tabs to space code!

```txt
	< This is not allowed! (used \t)
  < This is not allowed!
    < This is correct! (used 4 whitespace characters)
```

## File start

If the used language supports comments, it is recommended to start the file with a comment that specifies its use!
