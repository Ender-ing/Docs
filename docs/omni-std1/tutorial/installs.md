# Prerequisites

The Omniarium language only requires the developer to install development tools, the end-users of your projects
don't need to do any extra setup!

:::warning
No actual programs have actually been built yet, you may ignore this "*Get Started*" section!
:::

In order to get started with development in the Omniarium language, you must make use of the *Omniarium DevKit*,
which includes:

## Omniarium DevKit Downloads

***No actual downloads are available at the moment!***

### Integration Development Tools

In order to make your development process easier, Omni offers a collection of tools that can help you code faster and
more intuitively within your editor!
These tools are used by the supported extension for your editor.

### Libraries Manager

Omni heavily relies on custom libraries to enable specialised target transpilation. Therefore, a proper libraries manager
would be needed in order to facilitate the installation and management of Omni libraries.

### Transpiler

Omni makes use of a transpiler, a *source-to-source translator/compiler*, in order to convert Omni source code
into target source code.

## Editor Extensions Downloads

### VSCode

You may install the VSCode extension from the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Endering.omniarium-std1)!
