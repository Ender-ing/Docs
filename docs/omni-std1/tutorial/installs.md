# Prerequisites

The Omniarium language only requires the developer to install development tools, the end-users of
your projects don't need to do any extra setup!

In order to get started with development in the Omniarium language, you must make use of the
*Omniarium DevKit*!

## Omniarium DevKit Downloads

### Integration Development Tools _(in-progress)_

In order to make your development process easier, Omni offers a collection of tools that can help
you code faster and more intuitively within your editor!
These tools are used by the supported extension for your editor.

### Libraries Manager _(in-progress)_

Omni heavily relies on custom libraries to enable specialised target transpilation. Therefore, a
proper libraries manager would be needed in order to facilitate the installation and management
of Omni libraries. (this also includes a local external dependencies manager)

### Transpiler _(in-progress)_

Omni makes use of a transpiler, a *source-to-source translator/compiler*, in order to convert Omni
source code into target source code.

## Editor Extensions Downloads

### VSCode _(in-progress)_

You may install the VSCode extension from the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Endering.omniarium-std1)!
