# Introduction

Omniarium - or *Omni* - is an open-source multi-targeted metaprogramming language whose sole purpose is to enable
writing one flexible source-code instance meant to produce ready-for-use high-level code for multiple targets
(be it platforms, frameworks, or any of such)!

:::note
This language is still in its basic initial planning phase! Any and all suggestions could help shape and direct this
language to be a better aid for your needs, do not hesitate to provide any sort of criticism!
:::

The concept this language replys on is the fact that most programming languages share some core functionalities.
The `standard` library will only include the bare minimum functionality that can enable the source code to be compiled
to all the supported target lnaguages. Other than the standard library, there will be a collection of community-created
libraries for specific use cases!

## Getting Started

You may start with the [Tutorial](./tutorial/installs.md), which guides you through the process of developing with Omni.
You may also browse the [Examples](#getting-started) section to quickly get a better understanding of the language.

For more in-depth documentation, you may refer to the [Development](#getting-started) section
and the [Technical](#getting-started) section!
