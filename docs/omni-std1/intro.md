# Introduction

Omniarium - or *Omni* - is an open-source multi-targeted metaprogramming language whose sole purpose
is to enable writing one flexible source-code instance meant to produce ready-for-use high-level
code for multiple targets (be it platforms, frameworks, or any of such)!

:::note
This language is still in its basic initial planning phase! Any and all suggestions could help shape
and direct this language to be a better aid for your needs, do not hesitate to provide any sort of
criticism!
