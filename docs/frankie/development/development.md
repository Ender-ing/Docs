# Writing command line scripts

PolarFrankie consists of two core parts that can help you write cross-platform scripts:

- Built-in statements and rules: a collection of [keyword statements and rules](./language/language.md) that you must follow!
- Built-in libraries: contains most of the [commonly-used commands](./library/library.md) used on Windows and Linux!

You can use the `command` statement to define your own cross-platform commands!
