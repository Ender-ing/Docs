## Tabs and spacing

The use of the normal tab (*also known as a hard tab*) character (`\t`) is not allowed! You may use
**four** whitespace
characters instead of tabs to space code!

```txt
	< This is not allowed! (used \t)
  < This is not allowed!
    < This is correct! (used 4 whitespace characters)
```

## File start

If the used language supports comments, it is recommended to start the file with a comment that
specifies its use!

## Max line length

You choose to stick to one of a max of 80, 100, or 120 characters maximum line length for any file!
