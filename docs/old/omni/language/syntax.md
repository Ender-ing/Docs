# Syntax

Syntax refers to the rules and structure that govern how code is written. It's the grammar of the language, dictating
the order of elements, keywords, symbols, and punctuation. In order for you to write Omni code, you must follow the
syntax to a tee!

## Definitions

- [**Keywords**](#keywords): Words reserved by the language that have specific meanings or perform specific actions.
- [**Literals**](#literals): Constant values directly specified in the code.
- [**Identifiers**](#identifiers): Names given to variables, functions, classes, and other elements.
- [**Operators**](#operators): Symbols used to perform operations on values.
- [**Punctuators**](#punctuators): Special symbols used to delimit or separate elements.
- [**Data Types**](#data-types): These define the type of data a variable can hold.
- [**Comments**](#comments): Non-executable sections of code used to explain or document the code.
- [**Whitespace**](#whitespace): Characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines used for formatting.

## Keywords

Omni makes use of a range of keywords witin certain contexts. A keyword may be used for one context, or more, depending
on the contextual indication of the keyword!

### `keyword?`

**Example:**

```omniarium
// Example code!
```

## Unicode Character limitations

All unicode characters are permitted within your code, except for some
[*Private Use Area (PUA) characters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) (`\uE000` to `\uF8FF`), and
characters used by the target language!

:::info
You will be warned about the use of target-related characters within your code on transpilation!
:::

### `char?`

...

:::warning
If your code is detected to have any of the PUA characters that are in-use by the transpiler itself, your build will be
failed automatically and you will get error messages about said characters!
